-How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
    I feel pretty confident! Arrays are neat. Will maybe need a mneumonic device to remeber "push" "pop" "shift" and "unshift". 
-Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
    I will look through the Ruby documentation a little, and try to get the muscle memory down for each of the methods we learned.

-What questions do you have about Arrays?
    I noticed by accident that I can put an array inside an array (or another series as an array element, if you prefer). Does this get used often?
